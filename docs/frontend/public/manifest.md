# React App

## Description

This `manifest.json` file is a configuration for a Progressive Web App (PWA) built with Create React App. It defines metadata for the application, including its name, icons, and how it should behave when installed on a user's device.

## How to Use

This file is typically placed in the `public/` directory of a Create React App project. It is automatically referenced by the `index.html` file and used by web browsers and PWA installation processes.

## Technologies Used

*   **JSON**: The standard data interchange format used for configuration.

## Architecture or Code Overview

*   `short_name`: A short name for the application, used in places where the full name is too long.
*   `name`: The full name of the application.
*   `icons`: An array of objects, each specifying an icon's source path, type, and size. These are used for app shortcuts, splash screens, and favicons.
    *   `src`: Path to the icon file.
    *   `sizes`: Icon dimensions (e.g., "192x192").
    *   `type`: MIME type of the icon image.
*   `start_url`: The URL that loads when the user launches the application. `.` indicates the root of the web app.
*   `display`: How the browser should render the web application. `standalone` makes it appear like a native app.
*   `theme_color`: The theme color of the application, used for UI elements like the browser's address bar.
*   `background_color`: The default background color of the application's splash screen.

## Known Issues / Improvements

*   The icon paths (`favicon.ico`, `logo192.png`, `logo512.png`) assume these files are present in the `public/` directory.
*   Consider adding more icon sizes for broader compatibility across devices.
